# Dira - Decentralized AED-Pegged Stablecoin

Dira is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin solution for AED (United Arab Emirates Dirham), inspired by MakerDAO. Built on the Cosmos ecosystem, Dira allows users to mint AED stablecoins by locking ATOM as collateral, providing a stable on-chain value store and enabling seamless integration with the growing blockchain ecosystem in Dubai and beyond.

## Overview

Dira addresses the need for localized stablecoins in the Cosmos ecosystem. With the increasing adoption of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) in Dubai, Dira provides a reliable and decentralized AED-pegged stablecoin, backed by ATOM as collateral.

Dira will leverage IBC to integrate seamlessly with Cosmos chains, enhancing liquidity and enabling AED-based liquidity pools for cross-border transactions. By leveraging staking and liquidity pool fees, Dira also drives utility and demand for ATOM.

## Features

- **Decentralized & Overcollateralized**: Dira stablecoins are backed by ATOM, ensuring stability and security.
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Dira will leverage IBC to integrate with Neutron, Mantra, and other Cosmos chains.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Enables AED/USD stablecoin liquidity pools for efficient on-chain currency conversion.
- **Transparent Governance**: Admin functionalities are accessible only to approved wallets.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with Dira:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NotRithik/StableDira.git
   cd StableDira
   ```

2. **Compile the Smart Contract**
   Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the Cosmos optimizer for a production-ready `.wasm` file:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/target --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry cosmwasm/optimizer:0.16.0
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   Use `cw-multi-test` to test the smart contract.
   ```bash
   cargo test -- --show-output
   ```

4. **Deploy the Contract**
   Deploy the compiled `.wasm` file to a Cosmos chain.

## Smart Contract

The Dira smart contract is written in Rust using CosmWasm.

- **State Management**:
  - Collateral amounts, minted stablecoins, and admin addresses are stored securely on-chain.
  - Supports liquidations when collateral health drops below the threshold.

- **Query Functions**:
  - Public query endpoints provide transparent access to all contract states, including locked collateral, minted Dira, collateral prices, and admin addresses.

The smart contract repository: [Dira Smart Contract](https://github.com/NotRithik/StableDira).

## Frontend

A web interface is under development for user interaction with the Dira ecosystem.

- **Lock Collateral**: Users can lock ATOM to mint Dira stablecoins.
- **Mint/Burn Stablecoins**: Intuitive interface to manage minted stablecoins.
- **Liquidation**: View and liquidate unhealthy stablecoins.
- **Collateral Auction**: Participate in Collateral Auctions to buy liquidated assets.

## How It Works

1. **Lock Collateral**:
   Users lock ATOM as collateral in the smart contract.

2. **Mint Stablecoins**:
   The system calculates the user's collateral health, allowing them to mint stablecoins proportionally.

3. **Burn Stablecoins**:
   Users burn Dira to unlock collateral.

4. **Liquidations**:
   If a user's collateral health drops below the threshold, their collateral is liquidated by other users for rewards.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**:
  - Launch Dira on testnet.
  - Develop user-friendly web interface.
  - Conduct security audits.

- **Phase 2**:
  - Integrate with Neutron and Mantra via IBC.
  - Establish liquidity pools for AED/USD stablecoins.

- **Phase 3**:
  - Expand to other regional stablecoins (e.g., SGD).
  - Develop a multi-currency stablecoin DEX.
